# Dynamic GitHub Social Images

Sometimes the best tools are just 60 lines of TypeScript and a mass disregard for doing things properly.

## The Problem

GitHub has two different systems for repository images:

1. **Custom social preview** - Upload an image in repo settings, shown when sharing on social media
2. **Auto-generated card** - `opengraph.githubassets.com` generates a stats card with stars, language, description

The problem: if you want to embed a repo's social image in a README or profile, `opengraph.githubassets.com` ignores your custom preview and always shows the auto-generated card. And if you grab the direct URL to your custom image (`repository-images.githubusercontent.com/...`), it breaks when you upload a new one.

## The Solution

[ghlogo](https://github.com/heathdutton/ghlogo) is a tiny Cloudflare Worker that fetches whatever image GitHub is currently serving as the `og:image` for a repo.

```
https://ghlogo.heathdutton.workers.dev/owner/repo
```

It scrapes the GitHub page, extracts the `og:image` meta tag, and returns a 302 redirect to that URL. Custom preview if set, auto-generated card if not. Always current.

## How It Works

1. Request comes in for `/{owner}/{repo}`
2. Check in-memory cache (1-hour TTL)
3. If miss, fetch GitHub page and regex out the `og:image`
4. Return 302 redirect to the image URL

Uses 302 (temporary) instead of 301 because the image URL changes when you update your social preview.

The whole thing is ~60 lines of TypeScript with no dependencies.

## Usage

Works for repos, orgs, and users:

```markdown
![](https://ghlogo.heathdutton.workers.dev/heathdutton/ghlogo?ratio=3:2)
![](https://ghlogo.heathdutton.workers.dev/nim-ai/betterprompt?ratio=3:2)
![](https://ghlogo.heathdutton.workers.dev/anthropics?ratio=3:2)
```

I use it on my GitHub profile to show project thumbnails that stay current without maintenance.
